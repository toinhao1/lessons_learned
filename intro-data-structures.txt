1)A line of people at an amusement park ride.

The line is composed of members, represented as strings.
There is a front to the line, as well as a back.
When someone enters the line, place them at the end.
People may leave the line whenever they see fit, and those behind them take their place.
Given the above real-world information, use an array data structure to code the following solution.

a) Use an array input: ["Vivian", "Ava", "Josh", "Patrick", "Mike"]
b) Insert a new person, "Mary" at the end of the line. In other words, you should insert Mary after Mike.
c) Find a person in line named "Josh." This function should return the position of 2 in the array, (recall that arrays are 0-based).
d) Find a person in line named "Emily." What should your function return if it does not find the item in the array?
e) What if Ava wants to allow a friend, "Melissa", to cut in line in front of her? How would you code this so Melissa appears before Ava?
f) If Patrick wants to leave the line, how would you delete him from the array?

var line = ["Vivian", "Ava", "Josh", "Patrick", "Mike"]
line.push('Mary');
function findJosh(arr, namepos){
  return arr[namepos];
}
function checkLine(arr, name) {
    if (arr.includes(name)) {
      return true;
    }else {
      return false
    }
}
line.splice(1, 0, 'Melissa');
line.splice(4, 1);

2)Provide another real-world example that you can model using a data structure.

A: Test scores from a class would be a perfect fit for using arrays. Scores that come in and manipulating the array to find the mean, median and mode.

3)How would your data structure allow developers to access and manipulate the data?

A: The array is easily manipulatable with various methods and functions that can be used to find certain data points within the data structure.
