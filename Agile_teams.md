####Questions

>What are the typical Agile team roles and what parts of the development lifecycle is each role responsible for?

A: I am going to compare each role to a construction role. You have the Product Manager who is essentially in construction the developer the one who strategizes what and where to build something and the reason behind it. The Project Manager is essentially the contractor of the project who manages the teams that build out the product and will most likely be managing multiple projects at the same time. The designer as the name describes designs products so that the have a look and feel that the Product Manager is looking for or most likely a look and feel that is inline with a companies brand. The User researcher is the one who performs research to see what a typical user is like or creates various user personas so that products can be designed to please these users. A team lead is a job foreman who does some of the work but also makes sure the develop team is in line and getting the job done according to requirements. The Developer - 'My future self' is the one who builds the actual product with code.

>Why do we use Kanban boards in Agile development?

A: We use Kanban boards because they are cool. We also use them because they allow everyone working in the product team and elsewhere to visually see the progress of a certain project without even speaking. It also allows teams to break large projects into small tasks and eliminate each one at a time while progressing through an entire project and visually allow everyone involved the ability to see where certain issues are arising.

>Explain velocity and sprint as if you were teaching another student.

A: Velocity in agile teams is like the average amount of gas you would use per two weeks driving around. The sprint is the set time lets say two weeks of driving around. If you know the velocity of how much gas you use per sprint then you know how long certain projects will take with these two variables.

>What format makes a good user story?

A: The best format is `"As a __, I want __ so that _."`

>What are different estimation methods teams can use? Explain pros and cons of each method. Which method would you prefer?

A: There are several different estimation methods which are shirt sizes, Fibonacci numbers, and powers of 2 are a few. Shirt sizes have few options from xs to xl which you could also use multiple x's but i feel like are very general and limit how you can estimate a task. Fibonacci is the opposite where you have endless choices but that may be an issue in some projects where it is better to have a 5 options guide to estimate. With powers of 2 again you have unlimited choices but that may be a con in some instances. I would go with fibonacci numbers most of the time as I am heavily biased to them and they are naturally occurring numbers and I would feel more comfortable being able to estimate the difficulty or size of a task with them.

>Give a real-world example of a development project, and explain the breakdown into epic(s), slices, cards, and tasks.

A: Epic - Add subscriber sign up form to contact us page. Slice1 - Build out the front end. Slice2 - Build out the backend. Card1 - Create form in html. Card2 - write CSS to ensure the forms style goes along with the rest of the site. Card3 - Write the JS to send a new subscriber a confirmation email. Card4 - Write out the JS to make sure the new subscribers info gets stored in the appropriate database.

>Explain in your own words what a dual-track system is and what advantages it provides.

A: The dual track system is a way that a product development team works where you have strategy, research, and design on one team and the development team on the other. Both teams work at the same time to be more efficient and to ensure that no team is ever waiting on the other to finish a task.

>Choose one of the following projects and write each card that would be in the epic. Estimate each card. What columns would you need to have on your Kanban board?

**Creating a nursery for a new baby.**

>Kanban board columns

1. Research
2. Materials Purchased
3. In progress
4. Quality & Safety Check
5. Completed

>Cards

1. Change flooring to a soft and cushy material
2. Paint the room
3. Put furniture together
4. Put wall decorations up
5. Put stuffed animals in room
6. Baby proof the room, ie outlets and corners

####Project

>Create a Trello board for a Hacker News clone.

A: https://trello.com/b/7jnqD2Kb/hackernews-clone

>Create user stories for each feature.

1. As a reader I want news easily available so that I can read
2. As a internet user I want a site that has a great UX so that I can switch between pages very easy.
3. As a user I want to receive the latest news so that I can stay abreast to current events.

>Break the work into slices and epics as needed.

A: On trello board

>Estimate your cards.

A: On trello cards

>Explain what estimation methods you used.

A: I used the T-shirt estimation method as a hackernews site is pretty simple at least from my perspective.
