Programming Assignment

1.Create a function that takes two numbers and prints out the greater number.

A: Input first number
   Input second number
   IF fist number is greater than second number THEN
       PRINT first number
   ELSE
       Print second number
   END IF

   FOR each entry in phonebook
      IF obj is the same as entry in phonebook THEN
          RETURN obj
      END IF
   END FOR

4. Using the pseudocode you wrote for the previous question, implement it in any computer language of your choice.

A: function findEntry(obj) {
      for (var prop in obj){
          if (obj[prop] === phonebook[entry]){
              return obj[prop]
          }
      }
}
