1)What is a real-life scenario that uses linear search?

A: Looking through an unsorted file folder, if you are looking for a document from a certain date but the documents are not organized then you would have to go through each one until you found the one you were looking for.

2)What is a real-life scenario that uses binary search?

A: Searching for a book in a library would be a real life scenario.

3)Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many iterations would it take to find the value G using linear search?

A: It would be 7 iterations

4)Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many iterations would it take to find the value G using binary search?

A: It would take 3 iterations with Binary search.

5)Given an unsorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? Explain your reasoning.

A: We would have to use a linear search as the list of items is unsorted. It would not be efficient and be time consuming but between the two we would have to use Linear.

6)Given a sorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? Explain your reasoning.

A: We would use the binary search and we would be able to find what we are looking for much faster than with the Linear Search.

Programming Assignment:
1)You and a friend have set a wager to see who can find the word "Albatross" in the dictionary the fastest. Write a program to allow you to win the bet.

function searchWord(arr, word) {
  var start = 0;
  var end = arr.length -1;
  while (start <= end) {
    if(start === end) {
      var middle = start;
    } else {
        middle = Math.floor((end - start) / 2) + start;
    }
    if (arr[middle] === word) {
      return ('The word is in position ' + middle);
    }
    if (word < arr[middle]) {
      end = middle - 1;
    } else {
        start = middle + 1;
    }
  }
  return ('The word is not in the list');
}
var manyWords = ['albatross', 'dsfdfdfs', 'fsdffsdfsf', 'sfsdffsdfs', 'sdfdfgdfsgf'];

searchWord(manyWords, 'dsfdfdfs');

2)You work at a pet store, and a child has asked you to net the only white-spotted goldfish from the fish tank. Write a program that will help you net the right fish.

function findFish(arr, fish) {
  for (var i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    if (arr[i] === fish) {
      return ("Here is your " + fish);
    }
  }
  return "No " + fish + " left."
}
var manyFish = ['goldfish', 'goldfish', 'beta', 'blackfish', 'yellofish', 'goldfish', 'White-Spotted-Goldfish']
findFish(manyFish, 'White-Spotted-Goldfish');
